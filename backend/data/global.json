Bien que beaucoup d\u2019efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consentis par le gouvernement et les acteurs humanitaires, le pays reste encore loin de l\u2019instauration d\u2019une paix durable. A cette situation s\u2019ajoute les d\u00e9sastres li\u00e9s aux inondations ou incendies qui fragilisent davantage les populations d\u00e9j\u00e0 confront\u00e9es \u00e0 des d\u00e9fis structurels pr\u00e9existants.<br />\nLes conflits et catastrophes (inondations, incendies) ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le d\u00e9placement d\u2019environ 469.342 personnes au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2024 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale dont 392 235 install\u00e9es parmi les communaut\u00e9s d\u2019accueil et 77 107 h\u00e9berg\u00e9s dans 76 sites et lieux de regroupement spontan\u00e9s (CMP, d\u00e9cembre 2024)1. Au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2024 (de janvier \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre), plus de 220 000 personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9es par des chocs (111 alertes) rapport\u00e9s par le m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e9ponse rapide (Rapid Response Mechanism, RRM). La partie Nord-Ouest du pays (Ouham et Ouham-Pend\u00e9) restent la plus affect\u00e9e en concentrant plus de 57% des personnes ayant effectu\u00e9 un d\u00e9placement forc\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un choc en 2024. Environ 67% des alertes sont li\u00e9es aux violences, 20% aux d\u00e9sastres et 13% aux retours de populations2.<br />\nLes mouvements de populations engendr\u00e9s par l\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les catastrophes naturelles entra\u00eenent des cons\u00e9quences humanitaires pr\u00e9occupantes en termes d\u2019abris et d\u2019articles non-alimentaires. Le Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) montre que 17% des personnes affect\u00e9es vivent dans des abris inad\u00e9quats avec des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9es. Ce pourcentage atteint presque le quart des m\u00e9nages (25%) dans les pr\u00e9fectures d\u2019Ouham, Ouham-Fafa, Nana-Gribizi et Vakaga. D\u2019autre part, la MSNA souligne aussi que 46% des PDIs sur sites vivent dans des abris d\u2019urgence obsol\u00e8tes et d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s n\u00e9cessitant un renouvellement r\u00e9gulier pour les prot\u00e9ger contre les intemp\u00e9ries. D\u2019autre part, les nouveaux chocs engendrent aussi des besoins tr\u00e8s importants en Articles M\u00e9nagers Essentiels (AME) car les m\u00e9nages abandonnent leurs biens (parfois pill\u00e9s) dans leur zone d\u2019origine et ont besoins d\u2019articles minimums pour s\u2019installer et survivre dans leurs villages d\u2019accueil.</p>\n<p>Les nouveaux d\u00e9placements coexistent avec les retours de populations dans les zones propices au retour apr\u00e8s le retrait des groupes arm\u00e9s et la reprise du contr\u00f4le par les forces de d\u00e9fense et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Au moins 130.000 personnes retourn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pertori\u00e9es entre janvier et ao\u00fbt 2024 (CMP). De plus, les enqu\u00eates sur les intentions futures des PDIs men\u00e9es par la DTM montrent qu\u2019au moins 80% des m\u00e9nages d\u00e9plac\u00e9s sur sites et en familles d\u2019accueil ont l\u2019intention de retourner dans leur zone d\u2019origine, se relocaliser ou s\u2019int\u00e9grer localement et durablement dans leur lieu d\u2019accueil. Ce contexte induit le besoin d\u2019accompagnement progressif des PDIs les plus vuln\u00e9rables pour le retour ou la relocalisation afin de d\u00e9congestionner et fermer progressivement les sites de d\u00e9plac\u00e9s encore actifs dans le pays. Ce besoin est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 par les risques d\u2019\u00e9viction croissants auxquels environ le quart des PDI (23%) sont confront\u00e9s dans 13 sites sur 76. Ces sites sont localis\u00e9s dans les pr\u00e9fectures de Ouaka, Basse-Kotto, Ouham, Vakaga et Ouham-Pend\u00e9. Les abris constituent le besoin prioritaire pour appuyer le retour ou l\u2019int\u00e9gration locale de ces populations afin de les aider \u00e0 vivre dans des conditions plus dignes et d\u00e9congestionner progressivement les sites.</p>",

The hurricane caused significant damage particularly in the western and north-western parishes. The storm triggered widespread flooding, landslides, and road blockages, crippling critical infrastructure including hospitals, schools, roads, and telecommunications networks.</p>\n<p>Following Hurricane Melissa, Real-Time Monitoring coverage was scaled up significantly\u2014from just over 500 observations before the event (January \u2013 October 2025) to over 2,500 calls post-event. This expansion greatly improves visibility on emerging trends, though results should still be considered indicative rather than fully representative at parish level until sample sizes grow further.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note that areas without mobile network coverage are not captured, and food insecurity rates may rise as connectivity improves and more households are reached. Despite these limitations, the current data already highlight the severe impact of the hurricane on food security and livelihoods, providing an early signal of needs across Jamaica.</p>\n<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>\n<p>After Hurricane Melissa, short-term indicators (FCS and rCSI) improved slightly with emergency aid and market recovery, but FIES worsened, reflecting persistent worry and severe experiences such as skipping meals. At the same time, households shifted toward more harmful coping strategies\u2014emergency measures nearly doubled and remain concentrated in the west and north-west\u2014signaling livelihood stress and the need for sustained, multi-dimensional support beyond immediate food assistance.</p>\n<p>Insufficient food consumption surged from 7% pre-Melissa to 30% in November before easing to 23% in December, still far above pre-crisis levels. The worst impacts were seen in rural western and central parishes such as Clarendon, Saint Elizabeth, Hanover, Manchester and St Mary, where rates exceeded 30%. Diet quality also deteriorated sharply, with steep declines in fruits and vegetables and other nutrient-dense foods, while reliance on energy-dense food (sugar and fat) increased.</p>\n<p>High coping (rCSI\u226519) more than doubled nationally after Hurricane Melissa, peaking at 36% in November before slowly declining to 30% in December, with the worst stress and largest increases concentrated in rural western and northern parishes such as Westmoreland, Trelawny, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover. Moderate or severe food insecurity rose sharply from 33% pre-Melissa to 54% in December, two months after the hurricane, with the highest levels in rural western and northern parishes such as, Westmoreland, Saint Ann, Trelawny, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover\u2014indicating sustained deterioration and acute vulnerability.</p>\n<p>After Melissa, coping shifted toward severity: no coping fell from 32% to 22%, emergency nearly doubled to 19% (+9 pp) and crisis edged up to 27%, while stress strategies stayed roughly stable\u2014indicating greater reliance on asset-depleting measures. Severity peaked in weeks 3\u20136 (crisis approx. 30%, emergency 22\u201323%) and partially eased by week 8. In December crisis declined to 25% but emergency rose to 20%, signaling persistent livelihood pressure and risk of irreversible asset loss. Post-Melissa, the burden of severe coping is concentrated in the west/north-west.</p>\n<p>Market access deteriorated sharply after Melissa\u201453% of households faced challenges, peaking mid-month and remaining high into weeks 7\u20138\u2014while fresh foods recovered slowly, staples and hygiene rebounded quickly, and medicines showed volatile availability. The worst access constraints are concentrated in the west and north-west (e.g., Hanover, Trelawny, needs across Jamaica. Westmoreland, Saint Elizabeth).</p>",

Both authorities agreed to open two humanitarian corridors, enabling tens of thousands of families, mainly children, women, and the elderly, to flee on foot with few belongings. According to the latest estimates, approximately 30,000 families have been displaced, mainly in Afrin District, while others have found refuge with their extended families or in worship facilities used as temporary shelters in Aleppo City and Azaz. These figures are expected to rise as the situation continues to evolve. Children and women are particularly exposed to heightened protection, health, and nutrition risks, compounded by cold weather and overcrowded conditions.`</p>\n<p>The escalation has disrupted essential services, including schools, while Aleppo International Airport remains closed. The humanitarian situation remains fluid, with continued concerns for civilian safety, access to life-saving services, and protection of children and families.</p>",

Current estimates indicate that approximately 37,033 people are at risk, within the Licungo Basin, including potential impacts on households, schools and health facilities.</p>\n<p>The anticipatory action will be implemented over a period of five days, starting on 28 December 2025, and are expected to reach approximately 10,000 individuals, including children, women, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Planned interventions include the dissemination of early warning messages, community sensitisation and evacuation preparedness, protection of essential household assets, distribution of pre-positioned relief items, targeting the most vulnerable populations. These measures aim to reduce loss of life, minimise humanitarian impacts, and enhance community resilience ahead of potential flooding events.</p>",

It covers the period from 3rd \u2013 9th January 2026.</em></p>\n<h2>Situation and Impact</h2>\n<p>More than four weeks into the current phase of the Cambodia\u2013Thailand border crisis, the operating environment remains fluid, with reduced large-scale movements compared to the peak of displacement in December. Returns have started in some areas, but conditions vary by location. Response planning therefore covers both ongoing displacement and phased returns, guided by safety, access and the availability of basic services.</p>\n<p>As of 8th January 2026, the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) reported that around <strong>475,000 displaced people have returned to their places of origin</strong>. Approximately 173,776people remain displaced, including 91,170 women and 56,757 children of whom 64,018 are residing in 127 sites and 109,758 people are staying with host community/relatives. An unknown number from these displaced are unlikely to return any time soon due to contamination of their habitats from UXOs, house damaged, and insecurity. Needs remain significant among households still in displacement, particularly in relation to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, food assistance, shelter and non-food items, primary health care and essential medicines, and protection services, including support for children, women, older people and persons with disabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>At the same time, return movements are generating a parallel set of needs in areas of origin</strong>. Households are reporting gaps linked to disrupted services and lost assets, including damage to housing, limited access to safe water and sanitation, constrained access to health and education services, and reduced livelihood opportunities. Immediate priorities include ensuring safe and dignified returns through clear information and access to services, restoring basic infrastructure where feasible, and sustaining targeted assistance for the most vulnerable families both in evacuation centres and in return areas, including psychosocial support and strengthened community-based protection and referral mechanisms.</p>",

The majority of callers spoke about the hardships they are experiencing as a result of the ongoing drought, many of them describing extreme conditions with no water, lack of food and livestock fodder, dried up farms, and dead or sick livestock. Some callers indicated losing livelihoods and driven into destitution after being displaced by conflict. Farmers particularly in Hirshabelle areas complained of aphid attacks on their crops. The majority of calls overall came from central regions and southern regions. (There appears to have been a technical issue on the platform during the week limiting calls from northern regions \u2013 we are looking into this).</p>\n<p>The Radio Ergo platform is open to audiences across the country, many of whom call to share their daily lives and livelihoods challenges, whilst others engage with some of the thematic programmes we broadcast involving experts on health, farming, livestock, environment, mental health, and nutrition.</p>\n<p>We produce and share these weekly analysis reports in order to connect audiences (local communities) with a wider network of relevant stakeholders. The following summarises the week\u2019s calls by theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Health</strong> \u2013 a caller in Baidoa, Bay region, said he was living in an IDP camp, where there was severe drought and diseases were spreading, including whooping cough, measles, and more recently acute watery diarrhoea due to the water shortage. He added that the camp dwellers needed aid organizations to reach them with assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Nutrition</strong> \u2013 two callers had questions for experts about malnutrition among the elderly. One in Jowhar said they had an elderly person sick and suffering from malnutrition, but local NGOs mainly provided services to children and mothers. He wanted to know how the elderly could access help. A female caller in Lower Shabelle asked what mothers could do if they were unable to breastfeed their babies for two years, as advocated by doctors.</p>\n<p><strong>IDPs</strong> \u2013 in Baidoa, a caller in Bula-Jameo said he was among people displaced from Busle. They had lost their livelihoods and were facing hardships and poverty. In Lower Shabelle region, a female caller in Marka said people had been displaced from El-Warego area and were facing hardships in an IDP camp. She wanted her message to be shared to get help.</p>\n<p><strong>Livestock</strong> \u2013 among callers seeking veterinary help, some were concerned by parasites affecting camels and goats. A female caller in Qansahley, Gedo region, said their livestock were thin and sick, despite being given fodder. She wanted to know how to make them gain weight. A pastoralist in Jarirow, Hiran region, said the drought conditions in the area had caused livestock to be sick. They wanted to know how to treat their herds.</p>\n<p><strong>Agriculture</strong> \u2013 farmers in Beletweyne, Balad, and Jowhar complained of aphids destroying crops such as maize, tomatoes, and animal fodder. Others descried pests they didn\u2019t name eating various crops and vegetables. One caller said there were no crops on his farmland due to water shortage and he wanted advice on how to grow crops with little water.</p>\n<p><strong>Drought and water shortage</strong> \u2013 the biggest number of callers were focused on this topic. There were callers from across Galmudug. A female caller in Bohol said the drought was severe. Among several from Dusamareb, a female caller asked for help due to the drought and water crisis. A caller in Do\u2019oley said they had no water or livestock fodder. In El-dhere, a caller said their farms had failed and they needed help drilling boreholes to serve their water needs. Female callers in Higlale and Mirisyale said they had no water and that livestock were struggling and they needed aid. In Hiran, a farmer in Beletweyne noted the concerning drop in the river Shabelle water level. A female caller said their livestock were dying and the only available water was brackish ground water contaminated with minerals. Another said they were tired of constantly searching for fodder for their livestock. Several called from Middle Shabelle citing tough conditions affecting people and livestock. In Lower Shabelle, a caller in Shalabood said they lacked water and were appealing for help. A caller in Wanlaweyn said a jerrycan of water cost 7,000 shillings. A caller in Warsheikh said they were facing drought and conflict in the area and needed humanitarian intervention. In Janale, two female callers living in camps said they had been displaced by drought and conflict in Awdhegle and were destitute without water and no jobs. In Gedo region, a caller in Bardera said their livestock were dying due to the drought. Several called from Garbaharey citing challenges induced by severe drought. A caller in Luq appealed for food and water aid from agencies. Several callers from other unspecified Jubbaland locations cited hardships affecting people and killing livestock. Two females called from Ethiopia\u2019s Somali Region, including one in Ferfer, citing dead or dying livestock, lack of food, and appealing for aid.</p>",
