The operating environment was most severely affected in Jonglei, Upper Nile, Unity, and Western Bahr el Ghazal States, with conflict dynamics and administrative pressure increasingly converging to restrict humanitarian presence, movement, and programme delivery.</p>\n<p>In Upper Nile State, insecurity and access constraints significantly disrupted life-saving assistance. Food distributions for approximately <strong>40,000 conflict-affected people</strong> in Baliet and Nasir counties were delayed due to illegal taxation imposed on UN-contracted service providers, affecting planned movement of <strong>800 metric tons</strong> of assistance along the Sobat corridor. In Nasir County, county and state authorities ordered the withdrawal of humanitarian staff, resulting in the <strong>evacuation of six NGO staff</strong> and the suspension of December food distributions, with commodities temporarily confiscated pending access negotiations.</p>\n<p>Violence, intimidation, and threats against humanitarian personnel, facilities, and assets continued throughout the month. In Jonglei and Upper Nile States, local authorities forcibly entered NGO compounds and confiscated equipment. Along riverine routes in Canal/Pigi County, seven contracted commercial boats were detained at checkpoints, with demands of <strong>SSP 1 million per boat</strong>, disrupting humanitarian logistics along the Sobat River. December also recorded a serious aviation security incident, when an armed individual <strong>hijacked a humanitarian aircraft</strong> at Wau Airport, highlighting growing risks to air operations. Criminal incidents\u2014including armed robberies, burglaries, and theft of humanitarian and personal assets\u2014were reported in Juba, Renk, Bor, Wau, Pibor, and Aweil, further increasing staff security concerns.</p>\n<p>Bureaucratic and administrative impediments intensified, particularly in Ulang county in Upper Nile State. Authorities suspended staff from at least seven NGOs and three UN-affiliated partners over alleged recruitment malpractice, often despite prior approvals from State or National Ministries of Labour. Additional constraints included mandatory advertisement fees of <strong>10,000 SSP per position</strong>, renewed demands for county-level registration with <strong>fees of up to USD 200</strong>, restrictive recruitment directives, and new requirements for staff to collect work permits in person. In Renk and Ulang Counties, NGOs were instructed to submit detailed staff lists, payroll records, asset inventories, and 2026 workplans, with warnings that non-compliance could lead to suspension of operations.</p>\n<p>In Jonglei State, South Sudan People's Defence Forces orders issued in late December in anticipation of major military operations resulted in the <strong>relocation</strong> of humanitarian staff from Duk, Uror, Akobo, Nyirol, and Fangak Counties, with a number of NGOs relocating personnel to Juba, effectively suspending field activities and programme implementation across large areas.</p>",

The workshops convened 35 participants: the first day centered exclusively on veterans, their families, and families of the fallen, while the second day brought together veterans and institutional representatives from government, civil society, and international organizations. The workshops aimed to surface lived experiences of reintegration and translate them into actionable insights that bridge the gap between policy ambitions and practical implementation. By centering veteran voices alongside multi-sector stakeholders, the sessions created space for collaborative dialogue that informs both the recommendations presented here and Ukraine's broader veteran reintegration strategy. Thematic coding analysis supported the following key takeaways from the workshop transcripts, participant surveys, and activity outputs:</p>\n<p>1. Micro-Level Findings: The Lived Realities of Reintegration. Veterans' reintegration depends on managing highly variable responses to trauma, securing basic material needs alongside psychological support, and reconciling forward-moving identities rather than attempting impossible returns. These realities demand policies responsive to individual variation rather than uniform models.</p>\n<p>2. Meso-Level Findings: Communities and Social Context. Veterans face a gap between symbolic respect and lived reality: persistent stigma constrains employment opportunities, conditional recognition erodes trust despite high survey ratings, and fragmented memorialization practices undermine both social cohesion and national identity formation.</p>\n<p>3. Macro-Level Findings: Policy and Institutions. Despite extensive policy frameworks, fragmented coordination, opaque bureaucratic processes, and the absence of unified reintegration architecture mean that veterans' access to support depends on geography and individual initiative rather than functioning as a guaranteed, integrated system across government and civil society.</p>\n<p>4. Veteran-Led Solutions Findings. Veteran-led peer networks, localized initiatives, and grassroots organizations consistently prove more trusted and adaptive than externally imposed models, filling critical gaps in mental health support and community integration while demonstrating that sustainable reintegration depends on recognizing veterans, their families, and families of the fallen as co-producers of policy rather than passive beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>Building on the above analysis of the workshop data, as well as additional stakeholder interviews, observational data, and life history interviews (included in the Full Project Report), the following are the policy and program recommendations developed in the last section of this Brief:</p>\n<p>1. Institutional Strengthening and Coordination. Establish unified coordination mechanisms, interoperable data systems, and tiered governance structures that enable systematic policy implementation, cross-sector collaboration, and veteran participation from national to local levels.</p>\n<p>2. Psychosocial and Family Support Systems. Build an integrated national MHPSS network with competencybased professional standards, family-centered programming, and flexible funding for local and veteran-led organizations to deliver trauma-informed care across urban and rural areas.</p>\n<p>3. Economic Reintegration and Local Development. Create accessible pathways to employment and entrepreneurship through simplified enterprise support, public-private partnerships with hiring incentives, municipal targets with ring-fenced budgets, and networked veteran hubs that connect training to market access.</p>\n<p>4. Social Perception and Public Awareness. Counter stigma and build social cohesion through co-created national communication campaigns, official recognition insignia, standardized education in schools and workplaces, and cultural partnerships that portray veterans as multifaceted contributors beyond military identity.</p>\n<p>5. Veteran-Led and Peer-to-Peer Solutions. Empower veteran-governed organizations through dedicated financing mechanisms, formal consultative roles in policymaking, capacity-building support systems, and mentorship networks that recognize veterans as co-producers of effective reintegration policy and practice.</p>\n<p>Together, these recommendations provide an evidence-based roadmap for charting a path from fragmented support toward a coordinated, veteran-centered system that recognizes those who served\u2013and their families\u2013as essential architects of their own successful transitions and Ukraine's post-war recovery.</p>",
