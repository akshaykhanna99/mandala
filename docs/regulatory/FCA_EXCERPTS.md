CHAPTER
COBS 9 Suitability (including basic advice) 
(other than MiFID and insurance-based 
investment products)

Section : COBS 9.1 Application and purpose provisions
Application
COBS 9.1.1 This chapter applies to a firm which:
(a) makes a personal recommendation to a retail client in relation to a designated 
investment;
(b) manages investments of a retail client of the firm;
(c) manages the assets of an occupational pension scheme, stakeholder pension 
scheme or personal pension scheme,other than in relation to its MiFID, equivalent third 
country or optional exemption business or to an insurance-based investment product.
COBS 9.1.1A COBS 9A contains suitability requirements which apply in respect of insurance-based 
investment products, or in respect of a firm’s MiFID, equivalent third country or optional 
exemption business involving the provision of investment advice or portfolio management.
Providing basic advice on a stakeholder product
COBS 9.1.2 If a firm to which this chapter applies makes a personal recommendation in relation to a 
stakeholder product it may choose to give basic advice under the rules in section 9.6 of this 
chapter instead of the rules in the remainder of this chapter.
P2P agreements
COBS 9.1.3A This chapter does not apply to a firm which manages investments when that firm takes a 
decision to trade for a client and that decision relates to a P2P agreement. This is because the 
regulated activity of managing investments does not extend to the management of assets 
where those assets are P2P agreements.
Life policies for professional clients
COBS 9.1.5 If the firm makes a personal recommendation to a professional client to take out a life policy 
which is not an insurance-based investment product, this chapter applies, but only those rules 
which implemented the requirements of the IDD.
COBS 9.1.6 If a rule implemented a requirement of the IDD, a Note (“Note:”) follows the rule indicating 
which provision was being implemented. COBS 2.1 (acting honestly fairly and professionally), 
COBS 2.6 (additional insurance distribution obligations, COBS 4 (communicating with clients), 
COBS 6 (information about the firm, its services and remuneration) and COBS 14 (product 
information) contains contain further rules which implemented the IDD

Section : COBS 9.2 Assessing suitability
Assessing suitability: the obligations
COBS 9.2.1 (1) A firm must:
(a) take reasonable steps to ensure that a personal recommendation, or a 
decision to trade, is suitable for its client; and
(b) ensure that any life policy proposed is consistent with the client’s insurance 
demands and needs.
(2) When making the personal recommendation or managing his investments, the firm 
must obtain the necessary information regarding the client's:
(a) knowledge and experience in the investment field relevant to the specific type 
of designated investment or service;
(b) financial situation; and
(c) investment objectives;
so as to enable the firm to make the recommendation, or take the decision, which is 
suitable for the client and for a life policy, to propose a contract that is consistent with the 
client’s insurance demands and needs.
[Note: recital 44 to, and second paragraph of article 20(1), of the IDD]
COBS 9.2.1A A client’s insurance demands and needs are those which would need to be obtained under 
COBS 7.3 where a contract is sold without the provision of a personal recommendation.
COBS 9.2.2 (1) A firm must obtain from the client such information as is necessary for the firm to 
understand the essential facts about him and have a reasonable basis for believing, 
giving due consideration to the nature and extent of the service provided, that the 
specific transaction to be recommended, or entered into in the course of managing:
(a) meets his investment objectives;
(b) is such that he is able financially to bear any related investment risks 
consistent with his investment objectives; and
(c) is such that he has the necessary experience and knowledge in order to 
understand the risks involved in the transaction or in the management of his 
portfolio.
(2) The information regarding the investment objectives of a client must include, where 
relevant, information on the length of time for which he wishes to hold the investment, his 
preferences regarding risk taking, his risk profile, and the purposes of the investment.
(3) The information regarding the financial situation of a client must include, where 
relevant, information on the source and extent of his regular income, his assets, 
including liquid assets, investments and real property, and his regular financial 
commitments.
The information regarding a client’s knowledge and experience in the investment field includes, COBS 9.2.3

COBS
COBS 9 Suitability (including basic advice) (other than

to the extent appropriate to the nature of the client, the nature and extent of the service to be 
provided and the type of product or transaction envisaged, including their complexity and the 
risks involved, information on:
(1) the types of service, transaction and designated investment with which the client is 
familiar;
(2) the nature, volume, frequency of the client’s transactions in designated investments 
and the period over which they have been carried out;
(3) the level of education, profession or relevant former profession of the client.
COBS 9.2.4 A firm must not encourage a client not to provide information for the purposes of its assessment 
of suitability.
Reliance on information
COBS 9.2.5 A firm is entitled to rely on the information provided by its clients unless it is aware that the 
information is manifestly out of date, inaccurate or incomplete.
Insufficient information
COBS 9.2.6 If a firm does not obtain the necessary information to assess suitability, it must not make a 
personal recommendation to the client or take a decision to trade for him.
COBS 9.2.7 Although a firm may not be permitted to make a personal recommendation or take a decision to 
trade because it does not have the necessary information, its client may still ask the firm to 
provide another service such as, for example, to arrange a deal or to deal as agent for the 
client. If this happens, the firm should ensure that it receives written confirmation of the 
instructions. The firm should also bear in mind the client's best interests rule and any obligation 
it may have under the rules relating to appropriateness when providing the different service 
(see COBS 10, Appropriateness (for non-advised services)) and COBS 10A, Appropriateness 
(for non-advised services) (MiFID and insurance-based investment products provisions)).
Friendly society life policies
COBS 9.2.9 (1) When recommending a small friendly society life policy, a firm, for the purpose of 
assessing suitability, need only obtain details of the net income and expenditure of the 
client and his dependants.
(2) A friendly society life policy is small if the premium:
(a) does not exceed £50 a year; or
(b) if payable weekly, £1 a week.
(3) The firm must keep for five years a record of the reasons why the recommendation is 
considered suitable.

Section : COBS 9.3 Guidance on assessing suitability
COBS 9.3.1 (1) A transaction may be unsuitable for a client because of the risks of the designated 
investments involved, the type of transaction, the characteristics of the order or the 
frequency of the trading.
(2) In the case of managing investments, a transaction might also be unsuitable if it 
would result in an unsuitable portfolio.
[deleted]
Churning and switching
COBS 9.3.2 (1) A series of transactions that are each suitable when viewed in isolation may be 
unsuitable if the recommendation or the decisions to trade are made with a frequency 
that is not in the best interests of the client.
(2) A firm should have regard to the client's agreed investment strategy in determining 
the frequency of transactions. This would include, for example, the need to switch a 
client within or between packaged products.
[deleted]
Income withdrawals, short-term annuities and uncrystallised funds 
pension lump sum payments
COBS 9.3.3 When a firm is making a personal recommendation to a retail client about income withdrawals, 
uncrystallised funds pension lump sum payments or purchase of short-term annuities, it should 
consider all the relevant circumstances including:
(1) the client's investment objectives, need for tax-free cash and state of health;
(2) current and future income requirements, existing pension assets and the relative 
importance of the plan, given the client’s financial circumstances;
(3) the client’s attitude to risk, ensuring that any discrepancy is clearly explained 
between his or her attitude to an income withdrawal, uncrystallised funds pension lump 
sum payment or purchase of a short-term annuity and other investments.
COBS 9.3.3A (1) When a firm is making a personal recommendation to a retail client about the 
investment of funds in the client’s capped drawdown pension fund or flexi-access 
drawdown pension fund its suitability assessment under COBS 9.2.1R(1)(a) should 
include consideration of pathway investments.
(2) Pathway investments do not need to be considered where the personal 
recommendation is to purchase a fixed-term product that:
(a) provides a guaranteed income, a guaranteed capital return or both; and
(b) does not expose the client to investment risk, if the client remains in the 
product for the fixed term.

COBS 9.3.4 When considering the suitability of a particular investment product which is linked directly or 
indirectly to any form of loan, mortgage or home reversion plan, a firm should take account of 
the suitability of the overall transaction. The firm should also have regard to any applicable 
suitability rules in MCOB.
Investments subject to restrictions on retail distribution
(1) Firms should note that restrictions and specific requirements apply to the retail 
distribution of certain investments:
(a) non-mass market investments are subject to a restriction on financial 
promotions (see section 238 of the Act and COBS 4.12B);
(b) restricted mass market investments are subject to a restriction on direct offer 
financial promotions (see COBS 4.12A);
(c) contingent convertible instruments and CoCo funds are subject to a restriction 
on sales and on promotions (see COBS 22.3);
(d) mutual society shares are subject to specific requirements in relation to 
dealing and arranging activities (see COBS 22.3);
(e) deferred shares issued by a credit union are subject to specific requirements 
in relation to dealing and arranging activities (see CREDS 3A.5);
(f) credit union subordinated debt is subject to a restriction on direct offer financial 
promotions (see CREDS 3A.5).
(g) [deleted]
(2) A firm should be satisfied that an exemption is available before recommending an 
investment subject to a restriction on distribution to a retail client, noting in particular that 
a personal recommendation to invest will generally incorporate a financial promotion.
(3) 
(a) In addition to assessing whether the promotion is permitted, a firm giving 
advice on a designated investment subject to a restriction on distribution should 
comply with their obligations in COBS 9 and ensure any personal 
recommendation is suitable for its client.
(b) 
(i) In considering its obligations under COBS 9, a firm purchasing a 
designated investment subject to a restriction on distribution on behalf of a 
retail client as part of a discretionary management agreement should 
exercise particular care to ensure the transaction is suitable and in that 
client’s best interests, having regard to the FCA’s view that such 
designated investments pose particular risks of inappropriate distribution.
(ii) A restriction on promotion does not affect a transaction where there has 
been no prior communication with the client in connection with the 
investment by the firm or a person connected to the firm. Nonetheless, if 
promotion of a designated investment to a retail client would not have been 
permitted, then the discretionary manager’s decision to purchase it on 
behalf of the retail client should be supported by detailed and robust

Section : COBS 9.5 Record keeping and retention periods for suitability records
COBS 9.5.1 A firm to which SYSC 9 applies is required to keep orderly records of its business and internal 
organisation (see SYSC 9, General rules on record-keeping). Other firms are required to take 
reasonable care to establish and maintain such systems and controls as are appropriate to their 
business (see SYSC 3, Systems and controls). The records may be expected to reflect the 
different effect of the rules in this chapter depending on whether the client is a retail client or a 
professional client: for example, in respect of the information about the client which the firm 
must obtain and whether the firm is required to provide a suitability report.
COBS 9.5.2 A firm must retain its records relating to suitability for a minimum of the following periods:
(1) if relating to a pension transfer, pension conversion, pension opt-out or FSAVC, 
indefinitely;
(2) if relating to a life policy, personal pension scheme, stakeholder pension scheme or 
benefits in a defined contribution occupational pension scheme (unless otherwise falling 
in (1) above), five years; and
(3) [deleted]
(4) in any other case, three years.
COBS 9.5.3 A firm need not retain its records relating to suitability if the client does not proceed with the 
recommendation

Section : COBS 9.5A Additional guidance for firms with insistent clients
Purpose
COBS 9.5A.1 The guidance in this section is relevant where a client of a firm becomes an insistent client. The 
purpose of the guidance is to set out how a firm, when dealing with an insistent client, can 
comply with its obligations under:
(1) the Principles (see PRIN 2);
(2) the client’s best interests rule (see COBS 2.1.1R);
(3) the fair, clear and not misleading rule (see COBS 4.2.1R);
(4) the rules on suitability in this chapter (COBS 9 (Suitability (including basic advice)); 
and
(5) the rules on record-keeping (see COBS 9.5 (Record keeping and retention periods 
for suitability reports) and SYSC 9 (General rules on record-keeping)).
Who is an insistent client?
COBS 9.5A.2 In this section, a client should be considered an insistent client where:
(1) the firm has given the client a personal recommendation;
(2) the client decides to enter into a transaction which is different from that 
recommended by the firm in the personal recommendation; and

Information to be communicated to an insistent client
COBS 9.5A.3 (1) Where a firm proceeds to execute a transaction for an insistent client which is not in 
accordance with the personal recommendation given by the firm, the firm should 
communicate to the insistent client, in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading, and 
having regard to the information needs of the insistent client so that the client is able to 
understand, the information set out in (2).
(2) The information which the firm should communicate to the insistent client is:
(a) that the firm has not recommended the transaction and that it will not be in 
accordance with the firm’s personal recommendation;
(b) the reasons why the transaction will not be in accordance with the firm’s 
personal recommendation;
(c) the risks of the transaction proposed by the insistent client; and
(d) the reasons why the firm did not recommend that transaction to the client.
Acknowledgement from the insistent client

Section : COBS 9.6 Special rules for giving basic advice on a stakeholder product
COBS 9.6.1 This section applies to a firm giving basic advice, which has chosen to comply with the rules in 
this section instead of the other rules in this chapter (see COBS 9.1.2 R).
Range
COBS 9.6.2 A firm is permitted to maintain more than one range of stakeholder products.
COBS 9.6.3 A range of stakeholder products:
(1) may include more than one deposit-based stakeholder product;
(2) may include the stakeholder products of more than one stakeholder product provider;
(3) must not include any more than one:
(a) CIS stakeholder product or linked life stakeholder product; or
(b) stakeholder CTF; or
(c) stakeholder pension scheme.
COBS 9.6.4 When a firm provides basic advice it must:
(1) explain why it chose the stakeholder products and stakeholder product providers that 
appear in the relevant range; and
(2) give the client a list of the stakeholder products and stakeholder product providers 
that appear in that range;
if the client asks it do so.
Requirements on first contact
COBS 9.6.5 When a firm first has contact with a retail client with a view to giving basic advice on a 
stakeholder product, it must give the retail client:
(1) the basic advice initial disclosure information (COBS 9 Annex 1), in a durable 
medium, together with an explanation of that information, unless:
(a) it has already done so and the basic advice initial disclosure information is 
likely still to be accurate and appropriate; or
(b) the contact is not face to face and is using a means of communication which 
makes it not practicable to provide the basic advice initial disclosure information in 
a durable medium; and
(2) an explanation of how the advice will be paid for and the fact that any commission will 
be disclosed.
COBS 9.6.6A A firm will meet the requirements in respect of its obligation to provide written disclosure in the 
rules on describing the breadth of advice (COBS 6.2B.33R) by providing its basic advice initial 
disclosure information (in COBS 9 Annex 1 R).

(a) (if the communication is initiated by or on behalf of a firm), of the name of the 
firm and the commercial purpose of the communication;
(b) [deleted]
(c) that the firm will provide the retail client with basic advice without carrying out a 
full assessment of the retail client's needs and circumstances; and
(d) that such information will be confirmed in writing; and
(2) (if not provided at first contact) send the client the basic advice initial disclosure 
information (COBS 9 Annex 1) in a durable medium as soon as reasonably practicable 
following the conclusion of the first contact;
(3) (unless the relevant product is a deposit-based stakeholder product) if the contact is 
by spoken interaction, provide the client with the disclosure required by the rules on 
additional oral disclosure for firms providing restricted advice (COBS 6.2B.38R).
Sales process
COBS 9.6.9 When a firm gives basic advice, it must do so using:
(1) a single range of stakeholder products; and
(2) a sales process that includes putting pre-scripted questions to the client.
COBS 9.6.10 When a firm gives basic advice it must not:
(1) describe or recommend a stakeholder product outside the firm's range; or
(2) describe or recommend a smoothed linked long term stakeholder product; or
(3) describe fund choice, or recommend a particular fund, if a stakeholder product offers 
a choice of funds; or
(4) recommend the level of contributions required to be made to a stakeholder pension 
scheme to achieve a specific income in retirement; or
(5) recommend or agree that a client makes a contribution to an ISA which exceeds the 
HM Revenue & Customs ISA limits.
COBS 9.6.11 (1) If a firm starts the sales process for a stakeholder product that is not a deposit-based 
stakeholder product, it must not depart from that process unless it has advised the retail 
client that it will not provide basic advice on stakeholder products during the period of 
departure. A firm that does that must not provide basic advice during the departure 
period.
(2) Before a firm returns to the sales process for stakeholder products, it must tell the 
retail client that that process is about to recommence.
Suitability of recommendations
A firm must only recommend a stakeholder product to a retail client if:
(1) it has taken reasonable steps to assess the client's answers to the scripted questions 
and any other facts, circumstances or information disclosed by the client during the sales

process;
(2) (unless the relevant product is a deposit-based stakeholder product) having done so, 
it has reasonable grounds for believing that the stakeholder product is suitable for the 
client; and
(3) the firm reasonably believes that the client understands the firm's advice and the 
basis on which it was provided.
COBS 9.6.13 COBS 9 Annex 2 gives guidance on the steps a firm could take to help it meet these suitability 
obligations.
COBS 9.6.14 If a firm giving basic advice recommends to a retail client to acquire a stakeholder product, it 
must ensure that, before the conclusion of the contract, its representative:
(1) (unless the relevant product is a deposit-based stakeholder product) explains to the 
client, if necessary in summary form, but always in a way that will allow the client to 
make an informed decision about the firm's recommendation:
(a) the nature of the stakeholder product; and
(b) the "aims", "commitment" and "risks" sections of the appropriate key features 
document;
(2) provides the client with a summary sheet, which is in a durable medium and sets out, 
for each product it recommends:
(a) the specific amount the client wishes to pay into the product; and
(b) the reasons for the recommendation, including the client's attitude to risk and 
any information provided by the client on which the recommendation is based; 
and
(3) informs the client that in determining any subsequent complaint, the Ombudsman 
may take into account the limited information on which the recommendation was based 
and the fact that it was not tailored to take account of those aspects of the client's 
financial needs and circumstances not covered by the firm's sales process.
COBS 9.6.15 Notwithstanding COBS 9.6.14R (2) a firm may provide the summary sheet (COBS 9.6.14R (2)) 
as soon as reasonably practicable after the conclusion of the contract if the client asks it to do 
so, or the contract will be concluded using a means of distance communication that does not 
enable the provision of the summary sheet in a durable medium before the conclusion of the 
contract, but only if the firm:
(1) reads the summary sheet to the client before it concludes the contract; and
(2) sends the summary sheet to the client as soon as practicable after the conclusion of 
the contract.
Concluding the contract
COBS 9.6.16 If a firm concludes a contract for a stakeholder product with or for a retail client it must provide a 
copy of the completed questions and answers to the client in a durable medium as soon as 
reasonably practicable afterwards.

(2) When a firm provides basic advice on a stakeholder product, it may use the facilities 
and stationery it uses for other business in respect of which it does hold itself out as 
acting or advising independently.
COBS 9.6.18 A firm must ensure that none of its representatives:
(1) is likely to be influenced by the structure of his or her remuneration to give unsuitable 
basic advice on stakeholder products to a retail client; or
(2) refers a retail client to another firm in circumstances which would amount to the 
provision of any fee, commission or non-monetary benefit.
COBS 9.6.18A (1) A firm providing basic advice on a stakeholder product that is a life policy must, in 
addition to providing the statement of demands and needs required under COBS 7.3.1R, 
provide the client with a personalised explanation of why a particular life policy would 
best meet the client’s demands and needs.

and the type of client.
(3) The information in (1) must be provided in accordance with COBS 7.4.

Records
COBS 9.6.19 A firm must record that it has chosen to give basic advice to a retail client and make a record of 
the range used and the summary sheet (COBS 9.6.14R (2)) prepared for each retail client. That 
record must be retained for at least five years from the date of the relevant basic advice.
COBS 9.6.20 (1) A firm must make an up-to-date record of:
(a) its scope of basic advice, and the scope of basic advice used by its appointed 
representatives (if any); and
(b) its range (or ranges) of stakeholder products, and the range (or ranges) used

Section : COBS 9 Annex 2 Sales processes for stakeholder products
This Annex gives guidance on the standards and requirements to which a firm may have regard 
in designing a sales process for stakeholder products and assumes that firms will provide basic 
advice to retail clients who have no practical knowledge of investing in stakeholder products or 
investments.
General Standards – all sales
1. A sales process for stakeholder products may allow the 
representative administering it to depart from scripted 
questions where this is desirable to enable the retail client to 
better understand the points that need to be made provided 
this is compatible with the representative's competence and 
the degree of support offered by the firm's software and other 
systems. A software-based system is more likely to provide 
an adaptable means of providing prompts and support for 
representatives which may accordingly support a more 
flexible sales process.
2. Questions, statements and warnings provided should be 
short, simple and in plain language. Questions should 
address one issue at a time.
3. The sales process should enable the retail client to exit freely 
and without pressure at any stage. It should also allow the 
representative to terminate the process at any stage if it 
appears unlikely (for affordability, mis-match, risk or other 
reasons) that there is a suitable product for the retail client.
4. Where necessary the sales process should incorporate 
procedures to allow uncertainties in the retail client's answers 
to be addressed before proceeding and should generally 
reflect caution about proceeding if clarification or further 
information cannot be obtained during the process (for 
example if a retail client cannot confirm whether he or she is 
eligible for membership of an occupational pension scheme).
Preliminary - all sales
5. The retail client should be given the following preliminary 
information:
(a) the retail client will only be 
given basic advice about 
stakeholder products;
stakeholder products are (b)
COBS 9 Annex 2

COBS
COBS 9 Suitability (including basic advice) (other than 
MiFID and insurance-based investment products) www.handbook.fca.org.uk January 2026
intended to provide a 
relatively simple and low-cost 
way of investing and saving;
(c) the range of stakeholder 
products on which the 
representative will give 
advice to that retail client;
(d) the retail client will be asked 
a series of questions about 
his or her needs and 
circumstances and, at the 
end of the procedure, he or 
she may be recommended to 
acquire a stakeholder 
product;
(e) the assessment of whether a 
stakeholder product is 
suitable will be made without 
a detailed assessment of the 
retail client's needs but will be 
based only on the information 
disclosed during the 
questioning process; and
(f) the retail client's answers will 
be noted and, at the end of 
the process, if a 
recommendation to acquire a 
stakeholder product is made, 
the retail client will be 
provided with a copy of the 
completed questionnaire.
6. Following 5, the retail client should be asked if he or she 
wishes to proceed and, if not, the sales process should 
cease.
Affordability - all sales
7. If it appears that the retail client is unlikely to be able to afford 
a stakeholder product, the sale should be terminated and the 
retail client given an explanation together with a copy of the 
questions and answers completed to that point.
Financial Priorities and Debt - all sales

COBS
COBS 9 Suitability (including basic advice) (other than 
MiFID and insurance-based investment products) www.handbook.fca.org.uk January 2026
8. A retail client should be assessed to ascertain other possible 
financial priorities -for example, does the retail client need (a) 
insurance protection; (b) access to liquid cash to meet an 
emergency; or (c) to reduce existing debts? If appropriate, the 
retail client should be given an unambiguous warning about 
the desirability of meeting those priorities before acquiring a 
stakeholder product.
9. A stronger warning about the desirability of addressing debt 
as a priority should be given if it appears that the retail client 
is significantly indebted, especially if there is a strong 
indication that the debt commitments may render any new 
commitment unaffordable in the short-term. For this purpose 
a firm should consider using a threshold or indicator to decide 
whether a retail client should be excluded on the basis of 
affordability. Examples may include where the retail client has 
(a) annual unsecured debt repayments in excess of 20% of 
gross annual income or (b) four or more active forms of 
unsecured debt or (c) has consistently reached his overdraft 
limit. A firm should review its chosen indicator or threshold 
regularly to ensure that it reflects prevailing economic 
conditions and takes account of industry best practice.
10. A firm should clearly explain what it needs to know about a 
retail client's debt and consider using a range of alternative 
words (eg 'loans', 'student loans', 'borrowing' and 'other forms 
of credit') to ensure all relevant information is obtained. A firm 
may use a simple reckoner to assess retail client debt, but 
should be conscious of the nature of, and not give the 
impression that it is providing more than, basic advice.
11. If a firm gives a warning about the desirability of meeting 
other priorities before acquiring a stakeholder product, or 
about affordability, it should also invite the retail client to 
consider terminating the sales process.
Saving and investment objectives - all sales (except establishing a stakeholder CTF)
12. A retail client's savings and investment objectives, including 
the period over which the retail client wishes to save or 
invest, should be ascertained including whether the retail 
client:
(a) may need early access to 
some or all of the amount 
saved or invested; or
wishes to save or invest for (b)

COBS
COBS 9 Suitability (including basic advice) (other than 
MiFID and insurance-based investment products) www.handbook.fca.org.uk January 2026
retirement; or
(c) wants to accumulate a 
specific sum by a specific 
date.
13. If that information indicates that the retail client's objective is:
(a) to accumulate a specific sum 
by a specific date; or
(b) to save or invest only for the 
short term; or
(c) early access may be required 
to the whole of the sum 
saved or invested;
the firm should not normally recommend a CIS stakeholder 
product, a linked life stakeholder product, a stakeholder 
pension scheme or topping up of a stakeholder CTF.
Tolerance of risk - all sales
14. If a retail client is not willing to accept any risk of the capital 
value of an investment being reduced then CIS stakeholder 
products, linked life stakeholder products and stakeholder 
CTFs should not usually be recommended. However, a firm 
may, if appropriate, explain the effect of inflation on long-term 
savings especially in relation to pensions and invite the retail 
client to consider his attitude to risk in the light of that 
explanation.
15. If a retail client is willing to accept the risk of capital reduction 
in some circumstances but not others then, before any 
recommendation to acquire a CIS stakeholder product or 
linked life stakeholder product is made, the retail client should 
be reminded of the other circumstances in which he or she is 
unwilling to accept risk to capital.
Stakeholder pensions
16. A stakeholder pension scheme should not be recommended, 
and the retail client should be advised to seek alternative or 
further advice, if it appears that the retail client:
(a) has or will have access to an 
occupational pension 
scheme; or

COBS
COBS 9 Suitability (including basic advice) (other than 
MiFID and insurance-based investment products) www.handbook.fca.org.uk January 2026
(b) is likely to view income in 
retirement from state benefits 
as sufficient; or
(c) already has a pension to 
which he or she could make 
further contributions; or
(d) wishes to retire within five 
years.
17. It may also be appropriate to advise the retail client that other 
courses of action may be more beneficial than buying a 
stakeholder pension scheme (for example joining an 
occupational pension scheme).
18. A firm designing a sales process for use in the workplace 
may take account of the benefits offered by the employer. If a 
firm recommends a stakeholder pension scheme on the basis 
of benefits provided by an employer, then it should explain 
the basis of the recommendation to the retail client and 
suggest that the retail client seek advice if he or she has any 
concerns.
19. A firm should design its processes with a view to addressing 
the risk that retail clients will fail to appreciate the significance 
of questions about their pension provision and should 
accordingly incorporate a range of questions and information 
designed to foster the retail client's understanding of the 
issues and to elicit appropriate information.
20. Retail client should be told that a stakeholder pension 
scheme is life-styled and what this means.
21. A firm may provide a copy of the table setting out initial 
monthly pension amounts, found within the "Stakeholder 
pension decision tree" factsheet, available on 
https://www.moneyhelper.org.ukin accordance with COBS 13 
Annex 2 1.8R, but in doing so should also provide and 
explain the caveats and assumptions behind the table. A firm 
should make it clear that the decision on how much to invest 
is the retail client's responsibility and that they should get 
further advice if they have any concerns.
ISAs
A firm should ascertain whether the retail client has already 
opened a mini or maxi ISA and, if so, whether it would be 
appropriate for the retail client to open a non-ISA version of 
22.

[Note: article 76(3) of CRD]

 A CRR firm must ensure that the risk management function is able to report directly to the 
management body in its supervisory function, independent from senior management and 
that it can raise concerns and warn the management body, where appropriate, where

SYSC 7.1.22 The head of the risk management function must be an independent senior manager with 
distinct responsibility for the risk management function. Where the nature, scale and complexity 
of the activities of the CRR firm do not justify a specially appointed person, another senior 
person within the firm may fulfil that function, provided there is no conflict of interest. The head 
of the risk management function must not be removed without prior approval of the 
management body and must be able to have direct access to the management body where 
necessary.
[Note: article 76(5) of CRD]
SYSC 7.1.23 (1) This guidance is relevant to an SMCR banking firm that has appointed a head of the 
risk management function.
(2) Taking account of the nature, scale and complexity of its activities, the firm should 
have appropriate procedures to ensure that the removal or any other disciplinary 
sanctioning of the head of the risk management function does not undermine the 
independence of the risk management function.
(3) It will be appropriate, in many cases, for the procedures in (2) to include that any 
approval for the removal of the head of the risk management function requires the 
approval of a majority of the management body, including at least a majority of its 
members who do not perform any executive function in the firm.
(4) It will also be appropriate, in many cases, for any other disciplinary sanctioning of the 
head of the risk management function to require the approval of a majority of the
