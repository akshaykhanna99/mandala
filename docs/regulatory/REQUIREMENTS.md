## DO ✅

### Language & Output
- ✅ Use **probabilistic language**: "may warrant consideration", "suggests elevated risk", "indicates potential downside"
- ✅ Include **confidence levels**: "low", "medium", "high" with clear limitations
- ✅ Provide **explainable drivers**: List specific risk factors (e.g., "Sanctions risk", "Political instability")
- ✅ Include **limitations**: Acknowledge uncertainty, data constraints, model limitations
- ✅ Use **timestamped records**: Every scan must have "as-of" date and creation timestamp
- ✅ **Non-directive phrasing**: "Elevated downside uncertainty may warrant additional consideration given the client's stated risk tolerance"

### Documentation & Audit Trail
- ✅ Store **inputs + outputs**: Full record of what was analyzed and what was produced
- ✅ Include **metadata**: Model used, fallback status, validation results
- ✅ Make outputs **auditable**: Clear trail for compliance review
- ✅ Label as **internal tool**: "Internal decision-support only. Not financial advice."

### Suitability Support
- ✅ Frame as **supporting documentation**: "Designed to support suitability assessments"
- ✅ Reference **regulatory context**: Cite relevant FCA sections when possible
- ✅ Provide **scenario analysis**: Probabilistic distribution (low/moderate/severe scenarios)

## DON'T ❌

### Language & Output
- ❌ **Never use directive language**: "you should", "must buy/sell", "recommend", "advise"
- ❌ **No predictions**: Don't claim to predict future events or market movements
- ❌ **No guarantees**: Don't imply certainty or guaranteed outcomes
- ❌ **No client-facing tone**: This is internal documentation, not client communications
- ❌ **No investment recommendations**: Never suggest specific actions

### Functionality
- ❌ **Don't bypass human judgment**: Tool supports, doesn't replace adviser decision-making
- ❌ **Don't store client PII unnecessarily**: Only store what's needed for audit trail
- ❌ **Don't make claims about compliance**: Say "supports internal documentation", not "this is compliant"

## Key Principles

1. **Probabilistic, not predictive**: Output probabilities and scenarios, not forecasts
2. **Supportive, not directive**: Help advisers make informed decisions, don't tell them what to do
3. **Auditable, not opaque**: Every output must be traceable to inputs and methodology
4. **Internal, not client-facing**: All language and outputs are for internal use only
5. **Transparent limitations**: Always acknowledge uncertainty and constraints

---

## Example Good Output Language

✅ **Good**: "The scenario analysis indicates moderate-to-elevated risk factors that may require ongoing monitoring. Current probabilities suggest a balanced assessment of potential outcomes. Given the client's stated risk tolerance, elevated downside uncertainty may warrant additional consideration."

❌ **Bad**: "You should reduce exposure to Turkey. The risk is too high for this client."

## Compliance Notes

- This tool is designed to **support** suitability assessments, not replace them
- All outputs should be reviewed by qualified advisers before use in client communications
- The tool provides **decision-support** information, not financial advice
- Outputs are **internal documentation** and should be treated as such
